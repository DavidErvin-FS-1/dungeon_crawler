## Sub-Topic 2 - The Art of A/B Testing for Informed Decisions

The A/B testing guide on BrowserStack is an honest view of the need to test what really matters. Some key points are:

- **Purposeful Testing:** Not all things require an A/B test; be selective about significant performance drivers that have a direct impact on user interactions.
- **Iterative Learning:** A/B testing isn't performed once and doneâ€”each test should enhance our understanding and refine decision-making.
- **Skeptical Analysis:** Doubt repeatedly whether variables measured actually indicate user behavior or whether external factors are skewing findings.

## Sub-Topic 3 - Use Case Testing and Agile Planning

Combining use case testing results and agile techniques reveals a powerful approach to ensuring your project performs as intended yet remains flexible:

- **Use Case Testing:** Clearly defined use cases guarantee that application functions survive the test of user expectation, reducing unexpected failure.
- **Agile Techniques:** Utilizing technologies like GitHub Project Board, Issues, and Milestones facilitates open and responsive project management.
- **Critical Evaluation:** Recycle testing and planning strategies on a regular basis. Are they really leading to desired outcomes, or are they just part of an automated process?
