## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:
<br/>

⚙️ &nbsp; Overview - What I worked on this past week.
🌵 &nbsp; Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them.
🏆 &nbsp; Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week.
🔮 &nbsp; Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

### Week 1

#### ⚙️ &nbsp; **Overview**

This week I did some personal research to find out if I could utilize tools like [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) and [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to scrape data from a website to use in a project. Unfortunately, I found that the website I was interested in scraping data from had no regularly structured data. I spent some time trying to figure out if I could manage to scrape the data I wanted, but I was unsuccessful. So I turned to my old project from a previous class, a dungeon crawler game that I designed. I was unable to get authentication for the old repo working before unexpected events occurred. I won't get into details but I was forced to create a new repo and copy over some the details from it. Some of the details have been changed to reflect some new tools I would like to utilize and removal of some of the old ones. README's were updated to make them more readable and to reflect the new changes. I then turn to coding the client-side of the game. I setup Vite and React utilizing `yarn create vite . --template react` to get started. Then I installed any dependencies I know for sure will be utilized such as Tailwind CSS for our styling, React Router for page navigation, and Axios for API calls. I then created a few basic components and styled them with Tailwind CSS (e.g. button variations and menu) to utilize later.

#### 🌵 &nbsp; **Challenges**

This week was full of challenges for me. I looked into web scraping and the rules that come with it. I found that the website I was interested in scraping data that had no `robots.txt` restrictions. Due to the irregular data structure of the website, I was unable to scrape the data I wanted and wasted more time then I should've trying. I then turned to my old project and was unable to get Github authentication working for the old repository, this is when an unexpected event took me away from home for two and a half days. When I got back I wanted to get started immediately to get back on track. I created a new repo and copied over some of the details from the old one. I then updated some documents to reflect some new changes I'd like to make to the project. I then started coding the client-side of starting by setting up Vite and React utilizing `yarn create vite . --template react`, removed unnecessary files, and installed dependencies I know I will be using (e.g. Tailwind CSS, React Router, and Axios). I then created a few basic components and styled them with Tailwind CSS (e.g. button variations) to utilize later.

#### 🏆 &nbsp; **Accomplishments**

This week I learned a lot about web scraping and the rules that come with it. I learned about `robots.txt` and how it can be used to restrict web scraping. I also learned about the different tools that can be used for web scraping, such as Cheerio and Puppeteer. While I failed in my attempt to get the data, I did learn a lot from my research and attempts.

#### 🔮 &nbsp; **Next Steps**

Next steps are to get some more components coded and styled with Tailwind CSS (e.g. forms, input fields, game components, etc.) and begin working on the game pages design and layout.
